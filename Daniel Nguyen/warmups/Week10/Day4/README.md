# Wordy Calculator

Create code in Ruby or Javascript that takes word problems in the following formats:

> What is 5 plus 13?

> What is 7 minus 5?

> What is -6 multiplied by 4?

> What is 25 divided by -5?

and returns the answer as an integer.



To do this, you should define a calculator which has an answer method to return the answer.
Eg. `const query1 = calculation("What is 10 plus 4?");` or `const query1 = new Calculation("What is 10 plus 4?");`
Then `query1.answer();` to get your result.

You may want to reffer back to [this page from gitbook if working in Javascript](https://sei48tas.gitbook.io/sei48/week-1/day-5-advance-objects-and-function
), or [this page if in Ruby](https://sei48tas.gitbook.io/sei48/week4/day-5-activerecord)

Use a regular expression to parse the question.
